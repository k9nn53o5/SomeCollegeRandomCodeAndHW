Planning and Transportation Director Mike Nunn said the funding is planned for use in two categories: public services and economic development.

The first planned use, under the umbrella of public services, is called safety net funding.

¡§This continues to support our vital non-profit service providers with enhanced needs,¡¨ Nunn said. ¡§We haven¡¦t received any specific requests yet, but we have gotten interest.¡¨

Local organizations like Allied Churches of Alamance County and a few local food banks were some of the interested parties thus far, but any organization seeking funding would need to submit a formal request.

The second planned use also falls under public services in the form of utility payment assistance.

¡§This is only in low-to-moderate income areas ... to help (residents) get current on their past due residential utility bills. It would have to show that they¡¦re ... about to be terminated from that,¡¨ Nunn explained.

Funding would be paid to the utility provider to bring accounts current, not to the resident themselves.

An estimated $206, 817 would be directed toward these public service expenditures, Nunn said.

Under the economic development umbrella, the city plans to use the CDBG-CV funds for micro-loans to business owners in low-to-moderate income areas. Nunn said $70,638 is to be allocated to this effort.Planning and Transportation Director Mike Nunn said the funding is planned for use in two categories: public services and economic development.
